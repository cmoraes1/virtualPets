Lab 2 - Virutal Pet App

# About: #
The user can select from a list of pets to take care of them. A pet can only be played with if itâ€™s food level is above zero. A pet can only nap if its happy level is at least 5 and its food level is at least 3. A pet can only sleep if its happy level and food level are at least 10. When a pet is put to sleep, its values reset. The user can also randomly generate different pets to take care of if they do not want to choose from the one's provided on the main screen.
